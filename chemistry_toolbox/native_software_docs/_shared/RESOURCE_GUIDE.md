# Resource Guide

## CPU
The scheduler CPU request and software-level thread or process count must agree. Do not request more threads in the input than `resource_limits.cpu_cores`.

## Memory
`resource_limits.memory_mb` is the whole job allocation. Software memory keywords may be per process, per core, or total; follow the software topic and leave headroom for runtime overhead.

## Concurrency
Prefer one validated small job before launching a batch. Large concurrent Gaussian, ORCA, or VASP jobs can exhaust the task-wide budget even when each request is individually valid.
