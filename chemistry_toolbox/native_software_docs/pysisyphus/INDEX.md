# pysisyphus Native Software Guide

## Installed software
- Installed version: `1.0.0`.
- Operational status: `runnable_with_calculator`.
- Configured runtime: `reaction`.
- Primary use: geometry, transition-state, IRC, or chain-of-states optimization from a YAML configuration.

## When to use this interface
Execute a complete pysisyphus workflow configuration authored by the Agent. The native layer is appropriate when the Agent must author the software input or select version-specific options that are not represented by a preset Action.

## Documentation map
- `QUICKSTART.md`: complete staging, command, resource, submission, and collection flow.
- `COMMON_TASKS.md`: supported calculation families, input responsibilities, outputs, and validation states.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: high-frequency failure signatures, causes, fixes, and a pre-submission checklist.
- `examples/interface_smoke/`: the exact native command, toolbox request, and latest interface-smoke result.
- Additional topic files in this directory contain software-specific scientific mechanics where available.

## Supported command entries
| Executable | Input mode | Native invocation | Required staged inputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pysis` | `arguments` | `pysis config.yaml` | `config.yaml` |

## Supported task families
- minimum optimization.
- transition state.
- IRC.
- NEB.
- growing string.

## Layer 1 typed Actions
- `locate_transition_state`.
- `search_reaction_path`.
- `scan_reaction_coordinates`.
- `trace_intrinsic_reaction_coordinate`.

## Required knowledge before submission
The toolbox does not select a scientific method, force field, pseudopotential, basis, database, training set, convergence threshold, or workflow ordering. The Agent must obtain those choices from the task, a paper, or an authoritative source and then author a complete input.

## Test interpretation
An interface smoke proves that the configured executable can be resolved and started through `submit_native_job`. A scientific smoke additionally requires a valid input, normal software termination, task-specific convergence, and parseable expected artifacts. The two levels are recorded separately and must not be conflated.
