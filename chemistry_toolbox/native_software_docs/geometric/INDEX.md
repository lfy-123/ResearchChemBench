# Geometric Native Execution

## Purpose and supported version
Run the geomeTRIC command-line optimizer against an explicitly selected engine and Agent-authored input.

Configured runtime: `nwchem`. Detected versions: `1.1.1`

## Working directory and staging
The execution layer creates an isolated job directory and runs the exact argv vector there without a shell. Stage every referenced input with the exact filename used by the command or input deck. Relative paths resolve from the job directory, not from the task workspace root. Use `stdin_target` only when the command input mode below requires stdin.

## Commands

### `geometric-optimize`
Synopsis: `geometric-optimize [optimizer options] input.xyz --engine <engine>`

Input mode: `arguments`.

Required staged files: `input geometry and engine-specific files`

Output behavior: Writes optimization logs, trajectory, and optimized coordinates in the job directory.

Example argv: `geometric-optimize input.xyz --engine <engine>`.

Command-specific cautions:
- Engine, constraints, coordinate system, convergence thresholds, and engine method are not selected by the runner.

## Resource mapping
Set `resource_limits.cpu_cores`, `memory_mb`, `gpu_count`, and `walltime_seconds` explicitly. Keep software thread, MPI, memory, and GPU settings within those requested limits. The Supervisor enforces the per-job memory limit, CPU affinity, evaluator-wide concurrent reservations, walltime, cancellation, and process-group cleanup.

## Normal termination and scientific convergence
Exit code zero only establishes process completion. Inspect stdout, stderr, and the software's primary output for fatal errors and its documented normal-termination marker. Scientific convergence is task-specific: verify the requested optimization, electronic, ionic, frequency, dynamics, fitting, or projection criteria and confirm that every required result file is present and parseable. If the toolbox has no software-specific parser for this task, the status remains `not_checked` rather than inferring convergence from the exit code.

## Common immediate failures
- A referenced file was not staged with the exact target name.
- The command was authored for a different software version.
- An input deck contains an invalid keyword, section delimiter, or path.
- Internal thread, MPI, memory, or GPU settings exceed the declared resource limits.
- The process exits successfully but the main output reports a scientific or parsing failure.

## Preflight checklist
- Confirm the installed version and executable returned by `inspect_software`.
- Read this manual and any referenced official version documentation.
- Stage every input and nested dependency using the exact job-local filename.
- Declare a calculation intent when the task has a convergence contract.
- Match software parallelism and memory settings to `resource_limits`.
- Run `validate_native_job` before submission.
- After execution, inspect all status axes and the required output artifacts.
