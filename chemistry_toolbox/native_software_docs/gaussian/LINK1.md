# Gaussian Link1

## Segmentation
Separate jobs with `--Link1--`. Each segment needs its own route section, title separation, and valid molecule source. Use `%Chk` consistently when a later segment reads the checkpoint.

## Geometry reuse
When using `Geom=AllCheck` or `Geom=Check`, ensure the referenced checkpoint is created by the previous segment and use route keywords compatible with the intended reuse. Do not add conflicting coordinate sections.
