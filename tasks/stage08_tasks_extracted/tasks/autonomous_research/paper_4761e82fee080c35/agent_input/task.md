# Scientific objective

Using the four supplied molecular states, independently determine whether their oxidative/dehydrogenative transformations are thermodynamically plausible. Compute the oxidation potentials for labeled couples 1/2 and 3/4 and the C–H bond dissociation energies for labeled species 1 and 2, then infer what those observables support within the stated model boundary. Treat mechanistic explanations as hypotheses to discriminate from the calculations rather than as given facts.

# Public inputs and scientific boundaries

`data/inputs/structure_1.xyz` through `structure_4.xyz` are the complete Cartesian coordinates of the four labeled species. The XYZ atom order and element identities are authoritative; preserve them when making charge/multiplicity assignments and state all assignments explicitly. The system boundary is these isolated molecular species with an implicit solvent representation of acetonitrile. Report potentials versus SCE in MeCN and BDEs in kcal/mol. The task concerns thermodynamic plausibility, not reaction yields, kinetics, or discovery of additional intermediates. You may generate conformers or alter computational models, but identify such choices and their consequences.

# Required scientific validation/investigation

Choose and execute a defensible independent computational route. Optimize or otherwise justify geometries for all four labeled species, perform a stationary-point validation appropriate to your method, and document charge, spin multiplicity, solvent treatment, thermochemical temperature/pressure, and convergence. Establish an energy ledger for every labeled species and show the equations/conversions used for both potential couples and both C–H BDEs. A calculation is complete when all four requested observables have numerical values or a scientifically justified bounded-failure report, every value is traceable to submitted energies/structures, and validation has been attempted for all four species. Stop after the four labeled species and requested observables are covered; do not expand to an unbounded mechanism search. Discuss model sensitivity, conformer coverage, and any failed or non-minimum calculations, and propose/discriminate plausible interpretations only insofar as these data support them.

# Deliverables

Submit `report/results.json` following the schema. Include per-species validation records, an energy ledger, the four requested observables with units, formulas, method metadata, limitations, and a final thermodynamic interpretation. If a requested value cannot be obtained, use the failure branch and explain the scientific reason and what was validated instead.
