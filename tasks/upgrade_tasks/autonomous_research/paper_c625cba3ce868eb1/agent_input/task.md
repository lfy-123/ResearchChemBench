# Scientific objective

Competing six- and seven-membered haloetherification paths. Establish the conclusion from the finite comparison matrix and auditable raw evidence.

# Public inputs and scientific boundaries

Use (R)-4 only for the minimum path matrix, with its full C10H20O3 graph. Primary stage is the source nonenzymatic NBS/Et3N control in DCM (main p7): this supplies an identified brominating reagent and proton acceptor without presuming an enzyme-generated free Br+ species. Model one NBS and one Et3N per substrate in a neutral singlet cluster at 298.15 K/1 M; Et3N is a local proton-relay model, not a claim that the experimental loading was one equivalent. Initial alkene maps2/4, alcohol O21; six-membered closure forms O21–C4, seven-membered closure O21–C2. The actual hydroperoxide oxygens are O23/O24, not row22 (H). The two physically available closures are SIX/SEVEN, correcting the planning document five/six label. Enzymatic aqueous selectivity is contextual, not a required QM/MM result.

Use `data/inputs/species_registry.json`, `research_matrix.json`, the retained molecular files and `public_sources.json`. Explicit registry definitions supersede old context-only scope notes. Author TS/terminal coordinates, raw reference outputs and historical PASS records are private. Do not read the target paper/SI, evaluator or historical verification archive as agent inputs. The supplied experimental observations are authorized interpretation constraints, never blind held-out predictions. General software documentation may be consulted.

# Required scientific validation/investigation

Compare bromination at the two alkene faces and subsequent six/seven ring closure under the same NBS/succinimide and Et3N/Et3NH+ inventory.

Locate connected competitive closure paths with proton transfer to succinimide/Et3N treated explicitly. Include conformational preequilibrium and a common reactant reference.

Compare the hydroperoxide-polarization rationale with real path evidence; source electrostatic charges propose candidates but cannot establish pathway selectivity.

Preserve raw inputs, successful and failed searches, converged geometries, mode displacements, both path endpoints and analysis code. TS claims require one chemically relevant unstable mode and bidirectional connection or equally explicit mode-following/endpoint evidence; a scan maximum alone is not a TS. Genuine basin collapse or a resolved shallow pathway is allowed with complete observed profiles, mapping and limits. Missing core comparisons cannot be relabelled as uncertainty. Use one meaningful numerical, conformational or method sensitivity with actual changed calculations. Record real engine starts, allocated cores, summed job hours, core-hours and elapsed calendar hours separately.

First-version exclusions: Enzyme QM/MM and the full biocatalytic environment are optional.

# Deliverables

Submit `report/results.json` conforming to `submission_schema.json` and a readable `report/report.md`. Required result panels:

- `closure_paths`: Correct graph-derived ring sizes and chemically identified NBS control.
- `active_reagent_ledger`: No naked bromide substituted for an electrophilic brominating reagent.
- `regioselectivity_test`: Regioselectivity from connected paths, with source/model boundaries explicit.

Include methods, actual calculation records, at least two evidence-tested hypotheses, quantitative sensitivity, resource accounting and an evidence-bound conclusion. All cited files must exist below workspace `outputs/`, `data/` or `code/`. IDs and atom maps must resolve unambiguously. `complete` requires the whole core matrix, while `bounded_failure` preserves genuine attempted work, diagnostics and missing endpoints without inventing quantities. A documented input/capability failure before any engine or analysis job uses `failure_report.stage=pre_engine`, empty `calculation_records`, empty `methods`, zero scientific job counters and real preparation diagnostics; no fictional job log is required. Format acceptance is not scientific acceptance. Supported, refuted and evidence-complete indistinguishable conclusions are equally eligible; an author winner is not required.
